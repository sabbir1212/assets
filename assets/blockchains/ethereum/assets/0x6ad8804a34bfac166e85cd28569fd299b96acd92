## Contribution steps

1. Prepare image [requrimetns](#image-requirments)
2. Get familiar with [folder strcture](#repository-structure), will give you understanding where asset image should be placed
3. [Add asset guide](#how-to-add-asset)

## Image Requirements
- file extension: `png`. Uppercase `PNG` considered invalid.
- name：file name requirements for: `logo.png` name, but [folder naming](#repository-structure) where they placed is most important part of contribution
- size: `256px by 256px`
- background: preferably transparent
- use simple drag and drop online service [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/) to optimize image size

## Repository structure

`blockchains` folder contains many subfolders and represents chains e.g. `ethereum`, `binance` ...

`assets` folder contains token folders named by smart contract address in lowercase register and inside of it `logo.png` - image representation

`info` folder contains for now only `logo.png` that represents coin image
